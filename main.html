	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I am fascinated by the power of coding to bring ideas to life. The ability to write lines of code and see them transform into functional applications or websites is truly magical to me. I find immense joy in the process of problem-solving, breaking down complex challenges into manageable steps, and watching the pieces come together to form a cohesive solution.</p>
